What you’ll need

A webcam (or any camera) to capture video input

A programming language/environment (Python is common)

Libraries / tools such as:

MediaPipe (for hand landmark detection)

OpenCV (for video processing, drawing UI overlays, etc.)

A module to simulate key presses (e.g. pyautogui, keyboard, or similar)

Good lighting and a plain background help accuracy

How to build it — Steps

Set up Video Input

Use OpenCV (e.g. cv2.VideoCapture(0)) to capture frames from webcam in real time.

Hand Landmark Detection

Use MediaPipe Hands or a similar model to detect hands and compute the positions (landmarks) of key points: fingertips, joints, etc.

MediaPipe gives you usually 21 landmarks per detected hand.

Design Virtual Keyboard Layout

Overlay a keyboard UI on the video frames.

Define the “keys” (their rectangles or areas) — e.g. “A”, “B”, “C”, etc., spacing, layout.

Draw them using OpenCV (rectangles + labels).

Gesture Detection / Key Selection Logic

Decide how you will select a key. Some common ways:

Point finger (index finger tip) to key area + pinch with thumb to “press” it.

Hover over key area for short time, or detect when index-finger touches or gets near the key area.

Use the distance between two landmarks (for example between thumb tip and index finger) to detect "press" gesture.

Simulating Key Press / Typing

When you detect that the user has “pressed” a virtual key (via gesture + position), send a keystroke event to the system or application.

Use something like Python’s pyautogui or keyboard module for that.

Feedback / UI Improvements

Highlight which key is currently hovered over, so user knows what will be pressed.

Give visual or audio feedback when a key press occurs.

Make sure the virtual keyboard UI (size, position) adjusts to different screens/resolutions so it remains usable.

Testing & Tuning

Test under different lighting conditions, backgrounds, hand positions.

Tune thresholds (how close fingers have to be for a press, how long hover time is, etc.).

Try to reduce latency so typing feels responsive.
